# 360project -- Lets get this A
Project Description:
When a patient come to visit the doctor, first, meet and greet is the office staff nurse. Nurse will 
take vitals such as weight, height, body temperature, and blood pressure if the patient is over 12 
and  enter  into  the  system  associated  with  the  visit.  Then  the  patient  will  be  escorted  into  the 
examination  room  where  he/she  will  be  examined  by  the  doctor.  Before  the  doctor’s  arrival, 
nurse  will  ask  specific  questions  related  to  the  health  of  the  patient  such  as  known  allergies,  any 
health concerns and  enter to the system. At this time, the nurse will be able to see the patient’s 
history  including  previous  health  issues,  previously  prescribed  medications,  and  history  of 
immunization.  
Once  the  patient  is  ready  to  be  examined  by  the  doctor,  the  doctor  will  do  a  physical  test  and 
enter  any  findings  to  the  system.  If  any  medication  need  to  be  prescribed,  the  prescription  will 
entered into the system as well as the prescription will sent to the pharmacy listed in the patient’s 
records.  The  doctor  will  be  able  to  see  the  patient’s  history  including  previous  health  issues, 
previously prescribed medications, and history of immunization and any other recommendations 
will be made.
The patient portal of the system allows the user to create an account in the system. Each patient 
is  uniquely  identified  in  the  system  using  patients  first  name,  last  name,  and  the  birthday 
combination.  The  patient  will  be  able  to  see  and  change  contact  information  entered.  Also, 
patients  can  see  the  summary  of  each  patient  visit.  Also,  patient  can  sent  messages  to  the 
doctor/nurse with specific health related questions. When, the nurse or the doctor see a message 
sent by a patient, they can reply via email or through the patient portal. If urgent, they will make 
a phone call to the patient. 
In  addition  to  health-related  information,  this  office  automation  system  stores  patient’s  contact 
information, insurance information, and pharmacy information.
